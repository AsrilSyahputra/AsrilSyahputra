# Hi, I'm Asril ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently learning web development and using this GitHub to document my journey.  
I focus on building simple, responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### ðŸš€ What I'm Learning
- Front-end fundamentals: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- Making responsive layouts with Flexbox & Grid
- Version control with Git & GitHub
- Deploying projects on Netlify

### ðŸ§ª Learning by Doing

This GitHub is a collection of my learning projects, experiments, and small websites I build to practice and grow. One of my current projects:

- [Masjid Al Istiqomah Website](https://github.com/AsrilSyahputra/Masjid-Al-Istiqomah) â€“ A simple landing page for a local mosque

### ðŸ“Œ Goals
- Become confident in front-end development
- Build real-world, useful web pages
- Keep improving one project at a time
